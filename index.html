<center><b>Reading Response: Ends in Themselves</b><br></center>
<br>

From this week's reading, I'd like to respond to <a 
target="_blank" href="https://artful.design/"><i>Artful 
Design</i></a> Principle 1.5, which states:<br>
<ul>
    <font color="#339933">Principle 1.5: <b>Design is Means vs. Ends</b></font><br>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
—where <b>means</b> are “means to ends” (something that serves another 
purpose) 
and <b>ends</b> are “ends in themselves” (something worthwhile in 
itself).<br>
</p>

<p align="justify">

The idea that some things are <b><font 
color="#3399ff">ends-in-themselves</font></b> is pretty fascinating to me. 
Previously, I have normally just looked at designed things based on the 
needs that they fulfill, without much thought on why they themselves are 
fulfilling... As an example of this from my everyday life...[ETC ETC]

<!--
I find it really cool that certain elements, such as the fact that the 
pencil case is composed of a single zipper, are so satisfying, even though 
they fulfill no purpose what-so-ever. Realizing this aspect of design, I 
started thinking about the apps that I use, the music I listen to, etc., 
and wondering why it is that I use/listen to them, opposed to the plethora 
of other options. And, most of the time, the main reason I do is not from 
a functional standpoint, but rather because I find them satisfying in 
themselves. I think this is especially the case in music. While music can 
be a means-to-an-end, such as providing a deeper message or telling a 
story, I find that most of the songs that I listen to are 
ends-in-themselves. I don’t play a certain song because it fulfills some 
specific need, rather I listen to it because the song itself is 
fulfilling.-->

</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition, I'd like make a connection between this and a discussion from
class...[ETC ETC]</p>

<!-- (and a principle from Chapter 8) that technology is not bad, good, 
or even neutral very surprising, but it does kind of make sense. For 
instance, I feel that a good amount of the negative feelings toward 
technology have resulted from the ways in which designers have used 
technology in unethical ways. And I also feel that if we can find ways to 
use technology that searches for the sublime, there will be a change in 
people’s attitude toward technology.
