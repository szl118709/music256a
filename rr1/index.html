<center><b>Reading Response: Ends in Themselves</b><br></center>
<br>

From this week's reading, I'd like to respond to <a 
target="_blank" href="https://artful.design/"><i>Artful 
Design</i></a> Principle 1.5, which states:<br>
<ul>
    <font color="#339933">Principle 1.18: <b>Design is a thing in motion</b></font><br>
</ul>
<p align="justify">&mdash;I thought about the different ways how this is the case. For one, this applies to the nature that what we design <strong>interacts</strong> with people, including ourselves. For example in interface design, it is the interactions, rather than the results of those, that designers spend their time on. In fact, interface design can be thought of an end in itself. In the pencil case metaphor, the interface would be the "zipping the zipper", while the result of the interactions would be "closing the pencil case". I think many people who are obsessed with fidgeting their fingers can agree that the feeling of the interactions, instead of their results, is what drives us to interact in the first place.</p>
<p align="justify">I also loved the notion of the medium being the message because I think this emphasizes the <strong>process</strong> of designing over the end product. I have tried to explore this in my music -- often, I find the act of writing a song to be more important than what the song turns out to be. In that sense, I am prioritizing the experience of me, the designer, over the experience of the audience of my design. This selfish but honest idea makes me wonder if designer should invest more time on designing the interface that they use to design. Wouldn't that make the process (instead of the product) more enjoyable? In reality, not a lot of animators will work on the codebase of Unity, and not a lot of composers will create a new instrument. On one hand, everyone has to use tools that they didn't create in their creative process, and on the other, tools are created by people who are not necessarily their most frequent users. The gap here is interesting to me; how can we design tools without knowing the extent to which they will be used, and how can we adapt tools that weren't necessarily made for our exact purpose?</p>
<p align="justify">I think there can be something artful in this gap of tools and how we use them, just like how there is always a fun twist when a medium is not used for the message that people expect. In this sense, artful design is like the surprise that people experience when they learn that a thing has more to it than its function or form. &nbsp;</p>
